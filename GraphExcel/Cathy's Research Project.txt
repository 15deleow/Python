Cathy's Research Project:

- Clean up Excel sheet so it is more readable
- Create python script that will:
   * Parse the Excel sheet for Diabetes data, Cholestral data, blood pressure data, who has a provider, who has insurance.
   * Take this data and plot three graphs: Diabetes, Cholest., Blood Pressure
       - Each graph should contain people who have providers and insurance, providers and no insurance, no provider or insurance.
- Optional, create a GUI
   * GUI should ask the user for an Excel sheet, allowing the user to browse computer for file
   * There will be a button that will say analyze and once user clicks on it, will pass filepath to excel file and runs the python script
   * Upon completion of the analysis, will display the three graphs for the user to see.
